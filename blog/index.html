			<h2>Weird things that happen now #1: RULES of social media</h2>
			<p>Am I getting old or was the woman just lying? As a species we are tres getting weirder. Let us embrace the weirdness and clear up the RULES to make sure we are all ON BOARD*.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go on social media and wish happy birthday to people who AREN'T ON SOCIAL MEDIA, .i.e 1 year old nephew, dead auntie etc etc. Doesn't make sense? JUST DO IT. IT'S THE RULES. Always Remember social media ISN'T about real life or making sense.</li>
				<li>Take a PHOTOGRAPH of a pint of beer/glass of wine and SHARE IT. Just telling the world you are drinking is NOT ENOUGH, SHOW THEM TOO.</li>
				<li>If you are a girl or a sufficiently inane bloke and you are on holiday, obligatory photograph of legs must ensue. <br>Optional book-on-top-of-legs. IF book is one you wish the world to know you are reading, i.e. 50 SHADES etc.<br> Very unlikely in most cases anyone wants to see your pins but THESE ARE THE RULES.</li>
				<li>If you are thinking of joining a dating site, you MUST go on holiday and take a PHOTO of yourself cuddling a TIGER. For WOMEN, all photographs must be captioned with CITY photo was taken in, and DATE, even if photo is a selfie taken in a HOTEL ROOM and could be ANYWHERE IN WORLD for all it matters.</li>
                                <li>If you are COMMENTING on a youTube thread, you MUST pretend that you are a 9th Level black belt metaphysical solipsist and absolutely reject the concept of other people as independent beings 
                                with own thoughts, feelings or opinions. Other people are merely projections of your own self, and any opinions offered which differ to yours are declarations of war which have to be obliterated 
                                in the fiercest and most vociferous manner before schizophrenia sets in and you DIE OF PAIN.</li>
				<li>If uploading a PHOTO to Instagram, you MUST include as MANY HASHTAGS AS POSSIBLE, even if they are seemingly pointless ones, like #DAYTIME, #PICTURE, #HAND, #GROUND, #SKY #ME etc. <br>
				No one ever searches these hashtags so is utterly futile BUT IT'S THE RULES.</li>
				<li>If you are a GURL and are ANNOYED at someone, DO NOT TELL THEM. Upload a picture to Facebook which has some WORDS on it, which vaguely describe how you are FEELING. i.e.
				'REAL WOMEN DON'T HAVE TIME FOR WASTEMANZ, REAL WOMEN NEED REAL MEN', or 'LIFE ISN'T ABOUT HOW STRONG YOUR SANDWICH IS,
				BUT HOW MANY TIMES YOU CAN GET BACK UP AGAIN' etc</li>
				<li>If you are on TWITTER and see a link to an interesting article, RETWEET IT IMMEDIATELY even if it was originally tweeted by someone everyone in entire known universe ALREADY FOLLOWS and has ALREADY SEEN. Remember twitter is NOT about passing on useful/interesting links but TELLING THE WORLD YOU FOUND THEM FIRST(ish).</li>
				<li>If a female friend uploads a selfie to ANY social media, you must immediately and gushingly tell them THEY ARE
				UTTERLY UTTERLY SOCK-SHRINKINGLY BEAUTIFUL. If you are also female, you MUST use the word HUN as much as possible when doing this. If you are male feel free to also use word HUN but be prepared to be judged DAMNINGLY.</li>
				<li>If you ever find yourself in LAS VEGAS, or ANYWHERE that you deem to be quite a cool place, any PHOTOS you upload must include the words "[vegas||placename] BABY" in the caption.</li>
                                <li>GURLS: If you are being photographed and you suspect the photograph may end up on social media, then you MUST:<br>
                                    1. Stand slightly sideways<br> 2.Turn one foot out 3. Place one hand on thigh 4. Pout like a Babel fish retching up it's ribs. If you miss any one of these things YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY DIE AND LOOK FAT AT THE SAME TIME
                                and as any fule know, all these things MAKE EVERYONE BEAUTIFUL</li>

			<h2>overheard GURL conversation #231</h2>

			<p>GURL #2 #3 #4 all instantly combust and transform into anti-matter due to complete and utter cosmic ineffability; Universe then decides against long-standing policy of general

			kills herself with fire several times before hiding the body</p><br>

			<h2>Sausages Face</h2>
			<p>Sausages Face my greatly but gently butler, has taken his own self from this mortal coil; alas, I fed him not in the prior fortnight, 
			perhaps some guilt remains. His cause of death is a mystery that confounds all. My gentle fed well despite not being bred in me from the origin, so nurture provides always, 
			but less so for ill-mannered butlers who buttle poorly. But what does this mean for rabbit-haven royalters, except potato? 
			I am starting to suspect that nobody will ever know. Let us mourn this fact along with the demise of said ill-fated dusting comrade.</p>

			<h2 id="puttymo">Puttymo</h2>
			<p>Given that over forty and a one months time have passed since the Chalk Farm fiasco, I have recently felt the compulsion and possibly the desire, and maybe even the urge 
				if you will, to look into maybe taking up some new form of semi-employment. <br> 
				As those of you know me well will know quite well or even weller, I am a man who likes to keep busy, and must at all times be using my hands for constructive purposes. 
				Bad things have happened when I have become distracted or bored. For example I once knitted a badger to its own mind over a particularly quiet bank holiday weekend.
				<br> I have spent over twoty or threety years and thirty emblems at reed; it was there I first learnt to communicate solely with my eyebrows, how to make socks from road kill, how to cope
				with the unjustified vitriolic hatred from a hirsute colleague, and how to become employed through a care in the community program without	anyone actually finding out about my 
				uni-bottocked situation or my brain spoon.
				<br> For these reasons I have become quite attached to the place and thus it was quite a difficult decision to actually leave. I felt like a very handsome blister being suddenly ripped from its host.</p>
				<p>Needless to say there was much bewailing and bemoaning at the news of my impending departure.</p>
				<p>I do, as all who know well know well, have extremely sensitive ears, so I killed them all and set fire to the place</p>

			<h2 id="wren">Farming chalk</h2>
			<p>I was offered a position, namely that of chalk farmer. Chalk supplies in London are very low at the moment, due to a lack of natural predators, apparently (I was confused at this point). I accepted immediately.<br>
			Interestingly it was at a small to medium sounding farm in the Chalk Farm area.
			I had always wanted to farm chalk at a chalk farm in chalk farm. But I was very concerned that should anyone ask me what I did for a living
			it would sound faintly ridiculous.
			So I killed myself and set fire to the body fourteen times, to make sure no one found the evidence.<br> 
			I didn't apologise the recruiterment consulterant so I will probably remain in limbo for eternity like Universal Healthcare.<br><br>

			<h2 id="custard">Advert</h2>
			<p>Can you test that all of our custard is thick enough to meet our high standards?<Br><Br>
			By that I mean you should not be able to swim in it even if you are really really strong, like a carbon fiber whiskey.<Br><Br>
			When I was a boy, I often dreamt of working in a custard factory. Imagine, I thought to myself during one of my wetter childish reveries, imagine if I could actually walk about in a place that makes my favourite yellow non-newtonian liquid-based dessert. I would probably either die of happy, or just be quite pleased for a while until I realised it was a fruitless* dream and then moved on to the trifle factory down the road. (ha)<Br><Br>
			Either way, Imagine! I reveried. I reveried hard. Harder than anyone else of that era, to my knowledge.<Br>
			Today, that dream has come true. And even though you should never start a sentence with And, I want to share that never ending joy with you, an unemployed custard-ignoring fiend.<Br><Br>
			Imagine!
