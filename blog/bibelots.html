				<h2 id="piranha">Piranha-d</h2>
				<p>Like a once-happy handsome hock of ham, last week I fell victim to a vapid and vagariously vicious bastard-face of the highest order.
					I got piranha-d again. <br>
					Who but the meanest measlyest-minded meister of doom would predict that the dear and charming Covent Garden area would be such a sink of insidious and sinister stealer faces?

					<h2 id="puttymo">Puttymo</h2>
					<p>Given that over forty and a one months time have passed since the Chalk Farm fiasco, I have recently felt the compulsion and possibly the desire, and maybe even the urge if you will, to look into maybe taking up some new form of semi-employment.
						<br> As those of you know me well will know quite well or even weller, I am a man who likes to keep busy, and must at all times be using my hands for constructive purposes. Bad things have happened when I have become distracted or bored. For example
						I once knitted a badger to its own mind over a particularly quiet bank holiday weekend.
						<br> I have spent over twoty or threety years and thirty emblems at reed; it was there I first learnt to communicate solely with my eyebrows, how to make socks from road kill, and how to become employed through a care in the community program without
						anyone actually finding out about my uni-bottocked situation or my brain spoon.
						<br> For these reasons I have become quite attached to the place and thus it was quite a difficult decision to actually leave. I felt like a very handsome blister being suddenly ripped from its host.
