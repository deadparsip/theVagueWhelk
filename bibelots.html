				<h2 id="piranha">Piranha-d</h2>	
                                <p>Like a once-happy handsome hock of ham, last week I fell victim to a vapid and vagariously vicious bastard-face of the highest order. 
                                I got piranha-d again. <br>
                                Who but the meanest measlyest-minded meister of doom would predict that the dear and charming Covent Garden area would be such a sink of insidious and sinister stealer faces?

				<h2 id="puttymo">Puttymo</h2>	
                                <p>Given that over forty and a one months have passed since the Chalk Farm fiasco, I have recently felt the compulsion and possibly the desire, and maybe even the 
                                urge if you will, to look into maybe taking up some new form of semi-employment.<br>
                                As those of you know me well will know quite well or even weller, I am a man who likes to keep busy, and must at all times be using my hands for constructive purposes. 
                                Bad things have happened when I have become distracted or bored. For example I once knitted a badger to its own mind over a particularly quiet bank holiday weekend.<br>

                                I have spent over twoty or threety years and thirty emblems at reed; it was there I first learnt to communicate solely with my eyebrows, how to make socks from road kill, and how to become employed through 
                                a care in the community program without anyone actually finding out about my uni-bottocked situation or my brain spoon.<br>
                                For these reasons I have become quite attached to the place and thus it was quite a difficult decision to actually leave. I felt like a very handsome blister being suddenly ripped from its host.<br>

                                What actually snipped the final hair on my lumpy back parts, in the end, was my passing interest in Putty. I have always been fascinated by any substance that can be soft one minute, and then reasonably hard
                                only a few hours later (given the right temperature and humidity conditions).<br>  
                                So far, my time at Puttymo has been reasonably successful: my hands have been kept busy for the majority of the time, my brain also, and there are even chocolate bourbons for those of a will to eat chocolate 
                                bourbons. Of which I count myself one. Of.  Or sometimes 1.2 when I have eaten a large number of chocolate bourbons. Which is most days when there aren't custard creams. Cremes?.
                                Only time will tell if I am accepted - one can usually expect the withering-away-and-dying stage to commence within the first 6 months if I am not accepted by the host. There is quite a lot of me to wither so
                                I am confident I can escape if I need to.

                                </p>

				<h2 id="chalk">Farming chalk</h2>
				<p>Yesterday lifetime, I was offered a position, namely that of chalk farmer. Chalk supplies in London are extremely low at the moment, due largely to a recent growth in natural blackboard predators, 
                                apparently. <br>
				As a journalist/badger farmer/web developerer and table, this seemed to me like a natural career progression and in any case, I really really do like chalk, so I accepted immediately.<br>
				Interestingly, it was at a small to medium to large sized farm in the Chalk Farm area. This is just a few hundred miles north of Sydenham for those who aren't familiar.<br>
				I have always wanted to farm chalk on a chalk farm in Chalk Farm. I have to admit, this has long been a dream of mine. <br>
				But, dear feet, I was concerned. I was concerned that should anyone ask me what I did for a living, it would be difficult to guarantee that it would come out coherently every time. 
                                There might be occasions where I slur a little or I say "at chalk farm" instead of "on chalk farm". Or people might just think I have a stutter. They wouldn't necessarily UNDERSTAND.<br>
				Obviously, as any fule know, there is obvious danger here. It would in all liklihood lead to complete and utter chaos and maybe even death. I am not by my nature a man much inclined to chaos. 
                                I prefer something in the middle of chaos and order, leaning slightly to the chaos side of things. Think of a TK Max or something. But not as bad. Maybe a MacDonalds on a Saturday morning.<br>
				With less large multi-offsprung women in tracksuits. Slightly less. So, if you are reading this, Chalk Farm Chalk Farmers Recruitment inc, Chalk Farm, I am sure you will understand. 
                                I CANNOT TOLERATE CHAOS.<br><br>
				So I killed myself and set fire to the body fourteen times, to make sure no one found the evidence.<br><br>

				<h2 id="custard">Creamy Opening</h2>
				<p>Can you test that all of our custard is thick enough to meet our high standards?<Br><Br>
				By that I mean you should not be able to swim in it even if you are really really strong, like a carbon fiber whiskey.<Br><Br>
				When I was a boy, I often dreamt of working in a custard factory. Imagine, I thought to myself during one of my wetter childish reveries, imagine if I could actually walk about in a place that makes my favourite yellow non-newtonian liquid-based dessert. I would probably either die of happy, or just be quite pleased for a while until I realised it was a fruitless* dream and then moved on to the trifle factory down the road. (ha)<Br><Br>
				Either way, Imagine! I reveried. I reveried hard. Harder than anyone else of that era, to my knowledge.<Br>
				Today, that dream has come true. And even though you should never start a sentence with And, I want to share that never ending joy with you, an unemployed custard-ignoring fiend.<Br><Br>
				Imagine!
