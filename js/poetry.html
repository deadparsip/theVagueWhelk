		<h1>Vague whelk, recede from my face, lest I malevolently shrug</h1>
		<p>Poetry was invented in 1993, after a questionable accident with a circular saw, 3 pints of liquidated chicken, four nuns, and the offside rule. It has since gone from strength to strength, even once being mentioned in a newspaper underneath the heading "Poetry: So what's it all about?"</p>
		<p>Some poetry is dark and disturbing, like a Guiness poo. Here is a bit you can put in your mind. (Poetry, not Guiness poo). </p>

				I knew what would come of me<br>
				Fate had come to visit <br>
				Before I'd yet turned three<br>
				Fate was on a bit of a downer<br>
				And could only counsel thusly<br>
				Little boy, I have some news<br>
				And can I lick your knee?<br>
				After licking (and much more besides)<br>
				Fate would take his leave<br>
				But not before he reminded me<br>
				Listen up jsteve<br>
				money is a bastard and bankers are bummers<br>
				So make a promise now<br>
				when you are older you must save the world<br>
				Let me tell you how<br>
				By the time you have grown a full cok and ballz<br>
				The world will be much worse<br>
				Money will cause all sorts of fiscal grief<br>
				Like a rapist purse<br>
				A single currency will come and go<br>
				And jobs will disapear <br>
				markets slide like a wet snake on a tobboggan<br>
				And thus cause much to wetly fear<br>
				With that he turned to take his leave<br>
				And kicked himself in the ears to death, which I must say left an indelible mark on me, oh yes. I forgot all the talk of financial woes.</p>
				<p>When his words solidified<br>
				And turned themselves to real<br>
				I cast my mind right back to then<br>
				And stupid did I feel<br>
				Fortunately I was employed<br>
				at the prestigious IMF<br>
				I put together a plan of action<Br>
				I considered wise and deft<br>
				Auserity measures and public cuts<br>
				and quantitive easing enough to help an elephant rape a bank, seriously it would have slid right in, it was so eased (quantitively)<br>
				I'm tres useful innit.

				<p>The greeks they hmmmed and then they errrred<br>
				"you bladdy git, what you on aboaart" was all they had to say<br>
				I told them then and there that now<br>

				A Granville based liver<br>
				feeling far from fine<br>
				put on his hat, a nice yellow moleskin<br>
				packed up his bag<br>

				Unemcumbered with intellect<br>
				Your brainling,squashed by face(s)<br>
				Rejects sensibleness, like a force field of stupid, made out of pant.<br><br>
				Rejecting everything except dominoes, millions and G?LEE, (YOU LITERALLY LIKE GLEE!!!) you are devoid of factual content<br>
				Allergic to so much<br>
				You have a hard time<br>
				Phones, bags, and memory<br>

				<h2>Granville is a punk</h2>
				<p> Ode to granville: how the inevitable nihilism of an account handler would contrive to steal our favourite meaninglessly sized face <br>
				or <br>
				Granville is a punk <br>
				<br>
				<strong>1. Who are you? I don't know your head! Move your head!</strong><br>
				It started in Woking<br>
				<br>
				Fate's terrible joke<br>
				A lunatic in stupor<br>
				Drunkenly spoke<br>
				"My beaver done a poo"<br>
				It cried at its mate<br>
				Out popped a raven<br>
				With a face like a plate<br>
				What creature be this<br>
				What manner of species?<br>
				Why it's a baby granville<br>
				Nothing rhymes with species.<br>
				Except cheese.<br>
				I like cheese.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>2. She is thin and disappointing like a suicidal pancake</strong><br>
				Raised by pelicans<br>
				In a Woking hut<br>
				Life was a bit too surreal<br>
				for this large-handed idiot mutt<br>
				Tramping the wilderness<br>
				Like a homeless wooden spoon<br>
				Young granville would learn<br>
				harsh lessons very soon<br>
				Woking was tough and cold like a wrestler in a fridge<br>
				So she ran over her friend to death and evaded the law and had to move to clapham for a bit.<br>
				Fridge.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>3. Granville is rude and empty, like a pornographic beachball.</strong><br>
				When a rhino made an offer<br>
				Her face couldn't refuse<br>
				Granville went to Wimbledon<br>
				er, to worple mews (sorry)<br>
				A natural born account handler<br>
				She fitted right in<br>
				Although at first her cv was chucked in the bin<br>
				After some unpleasantness and a few violent episodes, she passed her probation, which is all history now. (note: no one was ever convicted)<br>
				<br>
				Did I mention she was a NATURAL BORN ACCOUNT HANDLER.<br>
				She was sat facing a wall, bright bright white<br>
				at the back of the orifice<br>
				simply to make sure her face didnt block all the light<br>
				MAYTAG WILL NEVER BE THE SAME<br>
				<br>
				<strong>4.She is unevenly-appendaged like an inconsistent octopus.</strong><br>
				The early days were tough<br>
				For the plate-faced raven<br>
				Her bright yellow hair<br>
				Was a little too brazen<br>
				Although it aroused in Rumsey a terrible desire<br>
				Consumed with rage<br>
				he set a carpet on fire.<br>
				Granville dyed her hair. Probably for the best really.<br>
				Now she looks like a startled pelican that has put its trousers on too early.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>5.Loud and full of wine like an urgent and troubled sink.</strong><br>
				Her terrible drinking<br>
				Then came to light<br>
				After marketing rounders<br>
				an eventful night.<br>
				a young handsome fool<br>
				Never a drop passed his lips<br>
				Was spurred on to alcoholism<br>
				And at least 1000 mozzarella dips<br>
				For probably a year<br>
				Things continued in this vein<br>
				Until it came to a head<br>
				Jon's head, in a drain.<br>
				Not just Jon but Ollie as well<br>
				Cider-can Messi woke up in Hell<br>
				Well, not hell but sergio's flat. In his pants. Covered in ketchup and sad.<br>
				<br>
				Her lust for the grape took her elsewhere<br>
				A night job in a bar<br>
				Where her natural flair (I.e getting pissed)<br>
				Held her in good stead<br>
				Drunken patrons cared not for the size of her head (large)<br>
				Perusing the menu, Granville thought of the fame<br>
				ENOURMOUS and covered in soft meaty chunks<br>
				The granville face pizza was aptly named<br>
				Eventually it ended as all things do<br>
				With horrific bowel pain and a granville-face sized poo<br>
				<br>
				<strong>6.She avoids Beaks, like a field mouse with post traumatic stress</strong><br>
				Now that the granville<br>
				Was bedded right in<br>
				Account handling for white goods<br>
				Drove her to gin (fair enough)<br>
				And this is where inevitably enough<br>
				Existential nihilism drew her in (like a warm muff)<br>
				Nothing exists<br>
				Except white goods<br>
				Life is pointless<br>
				And we will all be dead soon and the universe will be the same<br>			<br>
				FIN<br>			<br>

				<h2>JAMES MILLS</h2>

				note: To be recited in the fashion of Brian Blessed after a bong session<br>
				O James, who is like the AS400<br>
				Always turned on<br>
				But should have been decommisioned 20 years ago<br>
				James Mills, with his egg flavoured nightmare for a face<br>
				The face that isn't my favourite face around here<br>
				But is the one that is attached to his neck<br>
				so we pretend its ace<br>
				a face not as large as lisa-marie's<br>
				or as handsome as Jon Stevens'<br>
				but like a ghost's reflection in a dirty mirror<br>
				you haunt us<br>
				you haunt us dirtily<br>
				<br>
				Oh James, you remind us all of a Swedish meatball<br>
				perfectly round and usually covered in some sort of tomato-based sauce<br>
				but less meaty than expected and fairly bland, like a white sock<br>
				Your face means nothing most of the time<br>
				Even in the world of CE<br>
				<br>
				Your head, enormous, round and utterly hairless<br>
				Just like a baby's fist<br>
				but enormous and round<br>
				and with a tiny meaningless face drawn upon the front of it<br>
				a face which, while acceptable for client based meetings, has no place in a country like sweden<br>
				<br>
				your body is under you face<br>
				In the most predictable place<br>
				Attached to your neck in a really boring sort of fashion<br>
				it is like a pink balloon in a suit<br>
				and although well built for account managing<br>
				appears largely useless for everything else<br>
				You really are quite useless, quiet, and prone to playing merry pranks<br>
				but we have grown to accept you, if not quite like you<br>
				like a stubborn case of athlete's foot<br>
				or a cheese stain on my new shirt that cost a lot but o well that's life<br>

				<h2>GMAN USED TO BE 30</h2>
				<p>
				Graham Dunning took a swim <br>
				In his own sea of iniquity <br>
				When he came out <br>
				he was disgusted, and told the mighty sea, <br>
				In no uncertain terms <br>
				You wouldn't know the truth if it bit you on the ass! <br>
				The sea held its counsel <br>
				</p>
				<p>
				When he discovered, further up the beach<br> 
				He had turned 29 <br>
				he was hurt <br>
				truly, truly hurt <br>
				and his thoughts turned to crime <br>
				but soon it dawned upon the young masturbator,<br> 
				that indeed life does begin at 29 <br>
				for some <br>
				like his neighbour Mr. Burt <br>
				and his new wife (an alligator) <br>
				</p>
				<p>
				So thither and thus, did the Gman go <br>
				And wandered down the road <br>
				To the T bar, the one with bappage <br>
				The Danny Booth doth own <br>
				But verily did the bouncers <br>
				Look down upon the Dunning <br>
				Shift it mate <br>
				Get lost pal <br>
				The Rozzers here are coming <br>
				But Gman knew they were telling lies <br>
				And so killed them all and set fire to the bodies </p>
				<p>
				Once returned home to his bachelor pad <br>
				Did Gman remove his shoes <br>
				He removed one sock <br>
				Placed it on his cock <br>
				Then thought, no, Ill save it for later <br>
				Probably best <br>
				(As this poem is strictly PG rated) 
				</p>
				<p>
				To the pub with his friends <br>
				Did he instead head off <br>
				And had a well good time <br>
				He drank some beer <br>
				He spoke with a bevy of beauties<br> 
				And offered them all a line <br>
				He took one home, her name was Simone<br> 
				And then he bought her a chicken Dansak <br>
				But she ate it all and then ate his, and then she did a runner 
				Fuck. </p>
				<p>
				It was in thus an enlightened Gman <br>
				that decided to take his leave <br>
				of the curry shop <br>
				of the country <br>
				of his life. <br>
				He shot himself in the head 5 times.<br> 
				</p>
				<p>Which just goes to show really<br><br>

				<h2>Gman 30 and still big pimpin'</h2>
				<p>
				He's not a potato, <br>
				he's not a runner bean<br>
				He definately isn't a parsnip,<br>
				maybe something in between<br>
				What he is is 30, and very very dirty<br>
				Graham Dunning, Direct Marketing Machine<br><br>

				After giving birth to Nick, way back in '73<br>
				He decided to get a job, and support his new family<br>
				DM really was the only way to go,<br>
				So he said goodbye to Brooklyn, his ladies and his 'fro<br>
				he smartened up, he cut his hair, to England he would go.<br><br>

				Arriving soon in Croydon,<br>
				He wondered what to do,<br>
				I know, said he, I'll clean my shoes,<br>
				cos it appears I've stepped in poo.<br>
				But Gman was a stoical man, and worried not for shoes,<br>
				He set about for Wimbledon job centre,<br>
				For jobs he could peruse<br><br>

				After some initial unpleasantness<br>
				with a bouncer from Redhill,<br>
				Who Gman fought for half an hour<br>
				before being carted off by old bill<br>
				Gman found to his dismay,<br>
				his luck was out and his cell mate was gay,<br>
				but as I've said in the earlier verse<br>
				Gman was a stoic and not averse<br>
				To a little action with his brown purse<br>
				not really that never happened<br>
				Gman escaped in the back of a hearse<br>
				and made it here to wimbledon<br><br>

				Immediately drawn to a pub that was called smarts,<br>
				Gman sought refreshments, and a warm pint of Large,<br>
				he met a man called Goddard, who told him of a place<br>
				that employed people freely, regardless of age sex or race<br>
				even his criminal record could be overlooked for a price,<br>
				as long as in the interview he covered his face, <br>
				and did a little something to earn Goddards's good grace.<br>
				Gman found goddard the woman he was looking for,<br>
				at Boothie's T bar emporium,<br>
				that later turned out to be a man, but went like a bore. (Drill). ahem.<br><br>

				To those of us who know him,<br>
				and work with him every day,<br>
				We've come to accept him, maybe even to like him<br>
				In a certain peculiar way.<br><br>

				So that's how Graham came to work at D&amp;G,<br>
				He's been here ever since October '73,<br>
				Although he's a bit curt, and can be very rude,<br>
				He is acceptable at his job, and actually is,<br>
				a pretty cool dude.<br><br>
				Not pretty like sexy, that's another kettle of fish. It's very cold in here today isn't it.<br><br>

				<h2>Monkey Monn</h2>
				<p>30 years ago today <br>
				a spaceship landed in a field of hay <br>
				(and a bit of horsepoo, and some grit but that's not relevant) <br>
				<br>
				Some flashing lights, some metal rigging, <br>
				A ramp fell down, disturbing Fred and Rose from their digging <br>
				A beast descended, ugly as sin <br>
				Big top lip and glasses of steel, <br>
				Took one look at Rose and let out a squeal<br>
				hitched up his wedding dress and jumped out the ship<br>
				punched fred on the chin and pumped Rose a bit <br>
				OOer he's gotta be hard up, she's no looker is she! I'd rather do a horse.<br>
				<br>
				A little while later and the deed was done <br>
				Monkey Man was conceived <br>
				up Rosemary's bum <br>
				The beast took his leave, with a satisfied grin<br>
				Rose took off to Gloucester <br>
				and dumped baby monkey in a medical bin<br>
				<br>
				For the first 12 years he was incontinent and blind <br>
				He survived on medical waste and whatever else he could find<br>
				Until one fortunate day, a stranger did come <br>
				with three half naked ladies <br>
				and a Kaiser Chiefs tune he did hum<br>
				It was Dan Boof with his T bar Honeys! <br>
				and when he saw poor monkey man, <br>
				he was thinking of moneys (ooh, he's a right git, isnt he?) <br>
				<br>
				Come work for me, at my wonderful T bar! <br>
				A roof over your head, and all you can drink <br>
				The honeys will love you <br>
				what do you think? <br>
				OOK? cried poor monkey man <br>
				who had not yet learnt to speak (or indeed to spot an evil berk when he saw one) <br>
				Dan took this for a yes <br>
				and tied a rope round his beak<br>
				and off went the furry one <br>
				to start his new career the very next week<br>
				In a freak show/T bar, that's gotta be a first! Actually, I don't know, this one place I went to once was rotten, I didn't stay that long. <br>
				<br>
				One day at Dan's freak show T bar <br>
				the same spaceship landed <br>
				A bright orange glow <br>
				And out stepped a leg that was branded<br>
				with Ocean Colour Scene tatoos all the way up to the garter <br>
				Oh no, looks like it's Monkey Man's father! <br>
				I wonder what he wants, bit of a nerve, turning up after all these years! <br>
				Twenty pounds please, said a bouncer with very big ears (looks like Dan has a very selective recruitment policy)<br>
				A cricket bat in the face was the alien's reply <br>
				Thank you, the dead bouncer didn't say, cos he was dead.<br>
				<br>
				Inside the T bar, the alien searched <br>
				and found our hairy hero, oiling up a honey<br>
				Come with me Son, this isn't right for you <br>
				OOk! who are you, you look well funny <br>
				I am Gman, and I am your father! <br>
				I'm taking you home, actually maybe first to a barber. <br>
				OOOk I'm going nowhere, look at the jublies on this one <br>
				Come on son, I've got a banana! <br>
				And so off they went in the shiny spaceship, to the planet of Kenley, which I've never been to, but is apparently alright but a bit expensive considering. <br>
				<br>
				On the planet of Kenley, the monkey was strategically shaved <br>
				taught all about manners, and how to behave <br>
				Gman found him a job in a strange place called D&amp;G<br>
				Where monkey drew warranty based pictures all day <br>
				and drank herbal tea (wot a big girl!) <br>
				All was well for a year and a bit <br>
				then things started to change, and it all got a bit shit <br>
				He drove CommieDaw64 to a nervous breakdown <br>
				and stamped his feet all day, annoying the hiney <br>
				destroyed lots of hard drives <br>
				cos his willy is tiny. <br>
				<br>
				If you don't know who he is, he's the tall ugly fool with lots of hair and bendy limbs like a spagghetti man <br>
				wears clothes made of cheese cloth <br>
				and is never seen without a 29p soup can<br><br>

				<h2>If chins could cry</h2>
				<p>I tell you what<br>
				Mine wouldn't. But Bollard's might, in a bout of existential doubt and torment.<br>
				<em>Gok Wan, 1992</em></p>
		
				<p><u>Tears of a lonely Physician's chin</u><br>
				There waddles in our midst<br>
				a creature most foul<br>
				an old fat lady<br>
				All belly and jowl<br>
				What kind of creature be this, I hear you cry<br>
				Stalking our office<br>
				Like a steaming child Pie<br>
				It is only The bollard<br>
				rest assured<br>
				she is all gizzed up<br>
				the baby near fully matured<br>
				Like a baby shaped cheese, inside a cow with a long chin and copywriting hair, maybe in the field of grass.. The cow.<br><br>
		
				<u>Chins scream at me in the night</u><br>
				What of the bollard excepting her girth<br>
				what kind of bint is this<br>
				expecting a birth<br>
				you may know her as chin-on-legs-turd<br>
				a chin visible from mars<br><br>
				an unfortunate bird<br>
				Once courted far and wide<br>
				Touted as a potential Gman bride<br>
				<em>Until he found out her chin was a genetic thing, he couldn’t afford his children a chin like that, not with his tiny nose and enormous top lip and being on a register and everything. So he killed her and set fire to the body and then moved to Penge.</em><br><br>
		
				<u>Don't hit me, I am alone</u><br>
				So now the old duffer is well up the spout<br>
				From where do we expect<br>
				Our crappy copy to sprout?<br>
				Like tiny noxious sprouts of deceit growing in a field of horse’s doings, green hateful anti-emeralds glinting with all the false promise of a broken washing machine on a carpet<br>
				It pours forth from her quill<br>
				Like a torrent of brown words flowing from the cow’s anus until<br>
				All the washing machines are covered by 5 year plans<br>
				I’m confused<br><br>

				<h2>Piccolo's Hopes</h2>
				<p>Piccolo's Hopes For a New Beginning Turn out to Be Nothing But A Sour End, And Not Even An Interesting One, In Fact One We Have Seen All Too Many Times Before, So Here We Go<br>
				<br>
				When Piccolo and his hair<br>
				were but 24 years old<br>
				between them not a serious thought yet ever took hold<br>
				a young putney delinquent<br>
				with not a care in his face<br>
				A mind most absent<br>
				Sadly saturated with space<br>
				morally decreptit, she was fallen and bad<br>
				lower than her v-neck<br>
				and bordering on bad<br>
				Her only passions insipid and lacklustre<br>
				Everton football club, hair straightners and something else crap that rhymes with lacklustre<br>
				Get away you cretinous buffoon, you are no fit subject for poetry!<br>
				<br>
				The rapture of Piccolo came right out of the blue<br>
				She was fresh back from Canada,<br>
				And her hair must have grew!<br>
				For it was longer than a horse's maths test<br>
				and in a style somewhat new<br>
				she was looking worse for wear<br>
				sporting some colourful rashes,<br>
				and long girly hair<br>
				She got a bout a bit she did,<br>
				poor canadians bints, ey? She did loads of them!<br>
				Get away with your long hair you slaaaag!<br>
				<br>
				So, two lads from wimbledon took picco by the trouser<br>
				James Mills and Onion<br>
				Spied him as potential account handler<br>
				Some time later and mandatorily cropped<br>
				new picco emerged<br>
				and promptly flopped<br>
				ha ha no she didnt really, she wasnt all that bad, and handled accounts like a motherpumper she did. I'm not 100% but I believe it entails
				spreadsheets, organising meetings, and talking about numbers in the marketing meeting.<br>
				<br>
				So here we are, thirteen years later<br>
				Piccolo never repaid us<br>
				what a long haired putney traitor!<br>
				Picco is leaving, for the USA<br>
				Chasing her dreams<br>
				Go on then u r'tard, get away!<br>
				Get away from my face!<br>
				ur long hair is like that of a girl<br>
				In warranty its a disgrace<br>
				That's why everyone thinks you are an absolute bstaard who should get away<br>
				Like a sad horse's calculations, you don't make sense! Get away!<br>
				Get away.<br><br>
				How long have we known you<br>
				Accepted you, like an ill-chosen gift from an aunty that we don't really like, but tolerate, cos she is insane in her face, like sarah raymond but with a shorter neck, u get the drift<br>
				Get away from our faces!! Long hair!<br><br>

				<h2>Shakeela</h2>
				<p>with her FACE<br>

				a piping cackle of confusion<br>
				employed strenuously<br>
				at Ricky's hickies<br>
				and other FUNNY THINGS<br>
				YOU LAUGH AT FUNNY THINGS</p>

				to their rightful home<br>

				<h3>Pecker</h3>
				<p>
				<em>In the midway of this our mortal life<br>
				I found me in an office astray<br>
				Gone from the path direct: and keen to smell<br>
				It were no easy task, how savage wild<br>
				That pecker, how robust and rough a vision so strong --<br>
				But when a mountain's foot I reached, where closed<br>
				The valley that had pierced my heart with dread<br>
				I looked aloft, and saw his shoulders low and broad<br>
				Deeply vested with manic tartan insanity<br>
				A man with difficult short breath<br>
				one eyebrow that spoke more words than he could muster<br>
				"HAVE FUN!"<br>
				Divine Comedy, chapter 2: The Pecker, Dante<br></em>

				<p>1. Lo he Comes<br>
				Looming from the ether<br>
				offending light with visceral madness<br>
				a pecker approach<br>
				espied from afar<br>
				drain like cloth from gladness<br>
				</p>
				<p>2.<br>
				A terror that grips<br>
				wetly ahold, like a pensioner's handshake<br>
				You fear your heart<br>
				freeze not your sanity<br>
				nor your will to break<br>
				</p>
				<p>3.<br>
				Words tumble forth<br>
				from stooped apparition before ye<br>
				your nascent reproaches<br>
				crumble like old cake<br>
				yet your trousers now sodden with wee<br></p>
				<p>2.<br>
				It travels wide and far<br>
				Crossing oceans, seas and car park<br>
				Driven by a love for itineries<br>
				written in sperm,<br>
				and New York hookers charging to bark<br></p>
				<p>7.<br>
				Barbarian code, assembled furiously<br>
				In grey orifice wimbledon way<br>
				It's proximity to Mulas<br>
				and distance from lucozade factory<br>
				have conspired to steal the honey monster away<br></p>
				<p>8.<br>
				It's daily milk rounds<br>
				Engaged inquisition-like dialogue<br>
				Pecker aimed his chat<br>
				At all kinds of ladies<br>
				Most of whom kindly hide in the bog<br></p>
				<p>9.<br>
				A friendship forged of nougat<br>
				With evil swordfish-faced Ricky<br>
				Unlikely as it was<br>
				It saved many lives<br>
				And resulted in one enormous hicky (which was falsly blamed on vicky)<br></p>
				<p>10.<br>
				With mountainous rumblings<br>
				The creature doth depart<br>
				Bound to the steel-front-doored home<br>
				That sorely lacks for windows<br>
				With naught more than a rueful fart<br><br>
				GOODBYE PECKER<br>
