		<h2>A seal named Gerrard</h2>

			<p>A seal named Gerrard<br>
			with his fins upon the floor<br>
			swam accross my slumber<br>
			and thought he saw much more<br>
			sleeping in human form<br>
			he misconstrued my needs<br>
			swapping my spine for a curly bracket<br>
			despite my plaintive pleas<br>
			I live not on a keyboard!<br>
			I counselled him most wisely<br>
			But all I said was sadly in vain<br>
			as he told me nicely<br>
			you resemble in my eyes<br>
			some sort of punctuation<br>
			you're clearly mad, you're no more human <br>
			than I am oceanic crustacean<br>
			I killed him and set fire to the body before realising that I was probably going to be stuck this way for life.
