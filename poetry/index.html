			<p>my suspicion allayed<br>
			as warm concrete batter<br>
			(with no apparent incline)<br>
			I would buy many elements<br>
			it would attempt to flatter<br>
			to assign any real function<br>
			trinkets, a trifle, a bibelot<br>
			"This molecule scraper, it lacks for a handle"<br>
			"Mine pancreas resembles a hammond organ?"<br>
			"Your vibrating paintbursh, perhaps missold?"<br>
			"You of weakened wit may not comprehend functions beyond your field, desist your ignoble ignominy and cease your libellous leakage, lest I smite you as a 
			bongo botherer"</p>
		
			<p>It was thus I was misled<br>
			bereft of money and reputation<br>
			(that I deserved mostly)<br>
			laughed out of town<br>
			home and even yet police station<br>
			"His face was banjolele!"<br>
			"You speak asunder."<br>
			"His eyes mere flaps of tamborine"<br>
			"Your insolence a wonder. Cease your witterings lest I set about you like a warren-full of beavers; Get out!"<br><br>
			It was thus I learned I was irretrievably, inescapably insane.

				a frog at odds<br>
				in petering bogs<br>
				because he could not be<br><br>

				Porrig was jealous of all the frogs<br>
				jealous of their lillies<br>
				and jealous of their logs<br>
				but the problem with Porrig<br>
				the problem you see<br>
				Was Porigg's colour matched his jealousy<br><br>

				Porrig was green all over himself<br>
				green in the pond<br>
				and green on the shelf<br>
				green in the toilet<br>
				and green in bed<br>
				green from his legs to the top of his head<br>
				So poor Porrig decided<br>
				to be ANGRY instead<br><br>
