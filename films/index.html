			<h2>Horse with a Pen</h2>						
			<p>The premise for this film came to me one afternoon, after several solid minutes of wondering about how horses can't do some things that we take for granted, like
			looking behind themselves, laughing, shaving, sexing horizontally and writing. What better way to bring their plight to light, than to make a big budget weepy blockbuster with megastar Nic Cage in it? <br>
			You can thank me by being a little more	sensitive to horses in future.</p><br>

			<h2>Space Badgers IV</h2>
			<p>In the early 90s I spent a few years living in Borundi. While I was there I came across a rare species of badger called the Space Badger (rough translation). 
			The space badger comes in all different sizes, and is different from the common badger in that it reproduces but laying eggs. This discovery, and the consumption of fourteen pints of the local home brew together inspired me to have a fitful night's sleep, and a fearsome dream that lasted over nine hours. 
			I dedicated the next decade of my life to turning this dream into a film. </p><br>

			<p>The hugely anticipated sequel to War Badger sees our hero try to rebuild his life after the terrible bit of war that he was near in the last film.
			An interesting analysis of bits of war that, when near ordinary people (or badgers, geese, etc) can totes eff a guy up in the brain cupboard.</p><br>
