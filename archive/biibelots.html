		<h1>Vague whelk, look not upon my foul form</h1>
		<p>Poetry was invented in 1993, after a questionable accident with a circular saw, 3 pints of liquidated chicken, four nuns, and the offside rule. It has since gone from strength to strength, even once being mentioned in a newspaper underneath the heading "Poetry: So what's it all about?"</p>
		<p>Some poetry is dark and disturbing, like a Guiness poo. Here is a bit you can put in your mind. (Poetry, not Guiness poo). </p>

				<h2 id="wren">Farming chalk</h2>
				<p>I was offered a position, namely that of chalk farmer. Chalk supplies in London are very low at the moment, due to a lack of natural predators, apparently (I was confused at this point). I accepted immediately.<br>
				Interestingly it was at a small to medium sounding farm in the Chalk Farm area.
				I had always wanted to farm chalk at a chalk farm in chalk farm. But I was very concerned that should anyone ask me what I did for a living
				it would sound faintly ridiculous.
				So I killed myself and set fire to the body fourteen times, to make sure no one found the evidence.<br><br>

				<h2 id="custard">Advert</h2>
				<p>Can you test that all of our custard is thick enough to meet our high standards?<Br><Br>
				By that I mean you should not be able to swim in it even if you are really really strong, like a carbon fiber whiskey.<Br><Br>
				When I was a boy, I often dreamt of working in a custard factory. Imagine, I thought to myself during one of my wetter childish reveries, imagine if I could actually walk about in a place that makes my favourite yellow non-newtonian liquid-based dessert. I would probably either die of happy, or just be quite pleased for a while until I realised it was a fruitless* dream and then moved on to the trifle factory down the road. (ha)<Br><Br>
				Either way, Imagine! I reveried. I reveried hard. Harder than anyone else of that era, to my knowledge.<Br>
				Today, that dream has come true. And even though you should never start a sentence with And, I want to share that never ending joy with you, an unemployed custard-ignoring fiend.<Br><Br>
				Imagine!
