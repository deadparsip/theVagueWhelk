			<h2>Ron the sucidal ham sandwhich</h2>
			
			<p>There once was a ham sandwich called Gastric Ron. Gastric Ron lived in a pharmacy and had done so quite happily for seventeen sandwhich years.
			One day Ron was sitting on the shelf quietly rotting away, as no one had eaten him for literally days, when the pharmacist, Staircase Phillip, came over and said<br>
			"Ron. I am tired of seeing you cluttering up my shelf with your decaying self. Ham should be pink and tasty like a sunburnt Saturday, not green and mildewy like a dead jury.  
			You make me utterly utterly sick to my stomach parts and also quietly sad. Thus and so I am formally giving you 24 hours notice to vacate my pharmacy".<br>
			So it was that Staircase Phillip felt extraordinarily pleased with himself as he had been building up the courage to say this for over 41 and a half years. 
			Poor old Ron on the other hand was extremely sad and distressed, and thus decided to end his life.<br>
			In the back room he found a large supply of Zanex and resolved himself to take the lot with a bottle of parsnip gin that a tall handsome incredibly funny and great bearded guy gave him on 
			a night out in Weston-Super-Mare-upon-Croydon the previous weekend.<br>
			Only when it came to it, Ron discovered to his disdain that he had no mouth. Or indeed any orifices at all, which  went some way to explaining his slight depression and moribund sex life. <br>
			Although it didn't really explain the mouth ulcers.<br>
			Desperate and confused, Ron ran out into the road and threw himself to the ground, weeping, in the hope that a hungry dog might come by and scoff him up like a bacon crisp.<br>
			After 6 and a half untidy and bacon-free hours an old lady and an alsation came past in that order. Ron threw himself at the slavering demented doggy beast and cried<br>
			"Eat me now, foul slavering demented doggy beast, for I know not happiness in this mortal realm! And without happiness, what is life but a futile camembert! Do not look upon me as I die!"<br>
			The dog looked at Ron and cocked his head to one side. And then carefully burst into tears. He explained that he was a vegetarian and therefore could not be of any help in Ron's suicidal bacony ambitions;
			by funny coincidence he had also been going through quite a rough time of it just recently.<br>
			It seemed his canine peers had been very hurtful about some of his life choices and were mocking him on a daily basis. They had been calling him names like "Piss-skip", "Shyte-hawk", 
			"Cum beaker", "Dangerous Kidney", and "Colin". Although he didn't mind Colin quite so much as that was his name.<br>
			So it came to pass that together they concocted a plan: a plan to end their lives together, at midnight.</p><br>
			<p>Several hours later Ron and Colin met up at an industrial estate in north west Penge, just beyond Sydenham West, but not as far as Crystal Palace Observatory South. 
			It was actually about a quarter past midnight as Ron had had an unplanned masturbate before setting off and Colin was urinating out of the wrong hole.<br>
			"Did you bring the electrified trouser press Col?"<br>
			"I sure did buddy old pot. Did you remember the rubber pants and the elasticated frogspawn glove?"<br>
			"Certainment, mon frere. All is here." Ron looked at Colin uncertainly and then at the extra large rubber y-fronts he was wearing above his tail parts, and entertained certain thoughts.<br>
			"Please refrain from entertaining certain thoughts, guy. This is a strictly business arrangement yo. Are you still keen on going through with this or what?" <br>
			Ron tried to look at colin with as calm a face as was possible, given the current emotional turmoil that was turmoiling in his head area, and also given the fact that he was a ham sandwich and 
			therefore did not have an actual head or face part at all, except in the imagination of a deranged and bored foot.<br>
			"Yeeeah. Come on, let's get this over with". And with that Colin waddled over to Ron, (for the rubber Y-fronts were very loose and he had to do that funny walk to stop them from falling down, 
			you know that walk you have to do sometimes, 
			it looks like you have done a runny one or you are trying to grip a frogspawn in your nought).<br>
			They shared an awkward silent embrace during which Ron attempted three times to climb inside the rubber Y-fronts and Colin diplomatically blocked his entrance with the strategic 
			placement of his furry dog tail.<br>
			They climbed the forty three flights of stairs that took them to the top of the disused sock factory and made their way to the edge of the rooftop.<br>
			"It's quite a view isn't it. I think I can see Forest Hill zoo from here. Look, is that a giraffe?" Ron would have been squinting at this point and putting his hand accross his eyebrows, in that way 
			that always helps you see things that are small or far away, but being in an extremely ham-sandwhichy sort of mood he failed to do this and settled instead for an inquisitive yet crusty lean.<br>
			An especially green and manky part of his ham fell off and floted down the side of the building.<br>
			"Er, I think that's actually Lower Sydenham Cathedral you know."<br>

		   <h2>The yoghurty but still interesting existence of the Be Na Kol</h2>
			<h4><em>The woeful tale of a heightist community living inside a yoghurt</em></h4>
			<p>And all the world was white and creamy. It was said that it was modelled after the Goddess Ra's foot that had never seen daylight. <br>(And was made of cream.) <br>
			<br>This was interesting as the population of Be 'Nna Koll were a fungal species that did not possess limbs or appendages of any sort and most probably would not have been able to accurately tell the difference between a foot and a medium sized redundancy.</p>
			<p>Indeed, seemingly bizarre religious concepts were commonplace in Be 'Nna Koll and it was most fortuitous that the people who lived there were not by their nature very inquisitive. And certainly not prone to cynicism of any sort. Except when it came to madras.</p>
			<p>As Be 'Nna Koll was essentially an enormous cosmic bowl of yoghurt that revolved around the Great Unk' alBhens system, an enormous crispy ring that from a lot of angles resembles an enormous crispy ring, it had already occured to most of the Kyu Ra'a Nailz that theirs was a most unlikely existence and would not benefit from any kind of existential scrutiny.</p>

			<p>One of the Kyu Ra'a Nailz that was particularly unlikely to scrutinise his own existence, was Krsz P'ekk, a middle-aged, simple, but generally quite happy fungus based life-form.</p>
			<p>He was currently to be found celebrating the birthday of the neighbour's pet Ogg, a small six-headed domesticated beast much favoured by the Kyu Ra'a Nailz. The small Ogg was called Ree djhard E'Glish and, being an even lower order of intelligence than the Kyu Ra'a Nailz, had absolutely no idea that today was it's birthday.<br> This struck Krsz P'ekk as profoundly sad, so he decided there and then that he was going to attempt to infuse in the dog some form of sentient intelligence.</p>
			<p>A curious character trait amongst the Kyu Ra'a Nailz was a violent distrust of anyone shoerter or taller than the average agreed height. Generally the population would, as a whole, try to stick to the status quo and try not to grow less or more than 3 and a half pots in length, but, as in any civilisation accross the cosmos, there were those rebellious and nefarious types who decided being different was better than conforming.</p>
			<p>Every so often, one of these villains was to be found at Leeche Harvester Square, being first ritually humiliated, and then, if they were lucky, publicly executed. Krsz P'ekk just so happened to be quite interested in public executions and never missed an event. He was also quite good friends with the bacterium that was in charge of disposing of the lengthy or titchy cadavers. So it was that a plan hatched in this young simpleton's mind, or the place where his mind would have been, had he not been a fictional character made entirely of mould.</p>
			<br><Br>

			<p>"By Ra, hello, have fun!" squeaked Krsz P'ekk in his oddly high-pitched voice, as he approached the chief executioner bacteria based thing. And that.</p>
			<p>"May Ra make you prolific in the pot, Krsz P'ekk, you crazy spoonless simpleton", was the customary reply from Dayv Gbnee. Now Dayv Gbnee was an odd sort of Kyu Ra'a Nailz. Although not in a height-based capacity. He was exactly the correct height, er, 3.35 arms I think. The reason he was odd was that he actually didn't exist in any stable or normal sense of the word. Most of the Kyu Ra'a Nailz were yoghurt bacteria based lifeforms, consisting of semi-dense liquid/gas spores stuff, which is far too complicated for me to explain here in any credible way. But Dayv himself existed only in a purely metaphysical sense, and, as such, could only be perceived by other Kyu Ra'a Nailz if they placed a rusty spatula against their foreheads and squinted very tightly whilst thinking of trowels.</p>
			<p>He was however, a very pleasant and friendly Kyu Ra and so made friends easily, despite this fairly major hindrance.<br>Fortunately, Krsz was not one to be put off easily when it came to making friends, indeed it was so rare that anyone voluntarily spoke to him, that he had started to entertain thoughts of lassoos and handcuffs. Not that handcuffs would be any use on a yoghurt bacteria based lifeform.</p>
			<p>"I have had a lampshade. No, a wall chart. No, Ra deny it, I mean.... er, an IDEA!" Krsz beamed with satisfaction at the magnificent personal achievement of having successfully completed an entire sentence without the recipient having run away or commited suicide in the neck.</p>
			<p>"You are not holding the rusty spatula correctly, what. Keep it up. If we're going to be abstract metaphysical character types we at least have to be consistent. Don't be a deckchair."</p>
			<p>"Oh indeed Dayv, fuck you. No, sorry, I mean runt chaps. No, I mean THANK YOU! How did the execution go today, I was sorry to lick it, no, squeeze it, aarf, Ra string it up, I mean miss it!"</p>
			<p>"It went well enough, young fool. I used washing up liquid to turn him to stink, the short bastard face, with his tiny height."</p>
			<p>"Oh, washing liquid, my absolute third or fourth favourite method! Joy faces. What did you do with the buttock, argh, er, broadband, er, no REMAINS!" cried Krysz, his bacto nipples hardening with eagerness like a keen chocolate trumpet in the freezer.</p>
			<P>"Leave off Krysz you filthy table, I told you before, you are not allowed to sexually interfere with the-</P>
			<p>"Er, no no no nothing like that! I want to scoop out the soggy brain parts and stuff them inside my neighbour's pet Ogg, Ree djhard. I love him and play with him every day but he is just too sexy, er... I mean egg-shaped bossanova, I mean, er, Ra touch it lightly, I mean too stupid!" Krysz P'ekk's conversational skills tended to improve after around 5 minutes or so, but he rarely achieved more than two minutes. Fortunately.</p>
			<p>"Ra bless your toes until they melt, that is an excellent idea, I cannot believe a fool like you came up with it!" cried Dayv, his tiny yoghurty mouth flaps quivering in excitement and joy, and starting to leak yellow happy.</p>
			<p>"Marry me! I will take you to New York! I love you!" declared Krysz, immediately dropping on to one cleft and scrabbling about for his lassoo.</p>
			<p>"Get away you odd fucker! What do you mean New York, what is that?" Dayv was backing away from Kryz, his mouth flaps immediately drying up like an excellent wife after the washing activities.</p>
			<p>"O lord, it's happening again, I must save muself, I'm too sexy for Bacto-prison! By Ra I summon you my warrior Ogg, Ree djhard E'Glish... EMIT! no... er, POLITICALLY SANCTION! Ra, insert it gently! I mean ATTAAAACK!"</p>
			<p>This was an odd turn of events for two reasons. Firstly, the two were quite good friends and had never invoked demon pets to attack each other, and secondly because the dim witted Ogg who was not demonic in any way was not actually there to hear his good friend's cries. Oh, and it was also funny, because at that moment, Bi Sag Ranvil the wine merchant entered the execution pots and tripped over Krsz's gently quivering left cleftal part and fell on top of him in a screaming tumbling vortex of chaos and death and destruction!!! Ranvilll noo!!!</p>

			<!--<p>"Loar D'rummsee, you funky old bacto-bastard! What is going on!" Cried Dayv as soon as the lanky villain had entered the, er I think it was the back rooom? I don't know for sure, I wasn't there.</p>
			<p>Greetings each! O woe and lamentations upon the house of Rumms; is there a barmaid in the house? I require the services of a female Kyu Ra'a Nailz immediately. Preferably one that can stand in a corner and look slightly aloof while I fall in love at her loftily."</p>
			<p>"Erm, well Bi Sag is here, just in front of you? She isn't a barmaid but she has quite a decent amount of wine?"<br> The Loar peered down his large yoghurty beak at the swaying triple legged buffoon just in front of him.<br>
			"Oh, hello Ranvil, didn't see you down there. What is that you are standing on?" Ranvil looked confused, then brightened, and said "Erm, oh my leg parts? Yes! I am pretty sure they are my leg parts!"<br>
			"No, you poppadum faced berk, that sweating heaving mass of unconscious underneath your foot-parts! Look" The Loar bent down from his not inconsiderable lofty altitude and pulled up the P'ekk from his personal hell.
			"Have Fun" croaked Krsz P'ekk weakly. "Woe. Have Fun.. slumbering beneath the feet of Gods, is it not a Bacto's place to question the very nature of the universe?"<br>
			"?" Was the simultaneous response from all present. Apart from Bi Sag and Dayv and the Loar who were all picking their nose, quaffing wine, and attempting to read a potted plant in order to confuse the universe, respectively. <em>Well they are a slightly odd bunch, I'm sure made that clear.</em><br>
			"Have fun! Loar D'rumsee! My Loar! It is a great honour to meet you in the yoghurt! Ra spray it over my face, you are extremely tall!"<br>
			"Er, cough! Cough again! Woopsie, my bacto throat parts are tres sticky today! Who has wine? Pass some wine to your Loar would you Bi Sag?" The Loar seemed particularly keen to change the subject. <br>
			TweenLegs spluttered, and spilt bacto wine down her frontal clefts. Which made Krsz and Dayv go a bit woozy again. "Talk to me like that again and you will get a foot up the cleft, you deckchair." That was too much  for Dayv who left the room to go and check on something.
			"Dayv, come back, I need to talk at your facial part about something!" The Loar called after him. "O bugger." He sat himself down on Dayv's recently vacated bacto chair and sighed, draining wine. <br>
			"It has been a most unfortunate couple of days, TweenLegs" <br>
			"Yes I know. Engerland got totes hammered by Italy, I mean, we all knew they were a bit crap, but somehow we got carried-"<br>
			"What in Ra's teat flaps are you face-guffing about?"<br>
			"Sorry, I really don't know... I have no idea. Anyway, have some more wine you old moany poof". The two of them sat, drinking wine in a contentplative, er, contemplative, er, in a very thoughtful silence kind of thing.<br>
			"What am I going to do?" Rumsey asked, on the verge on milky tears. "Jee M'ann seems to have it in for me. He has issued a warrant for my arrest, and immediate liquifying. O Woe upon me, sadness upon the house of Rumms" With that, the milky tears started to stream down the Loar's face like milky space invaders attacking his facial parts like a helpless poorly defended yoghurt based planetoid.<br>
			"zzzzzz" TweenLegs was asleep and slightly dribbling. Unbeknownst to the Loar, who carried on talking, she was dreaming about tiny cola flavoured balls of crack that came in rectangular packets, in something called a Nuu S'ajent.<br>
			"I have tried to lead a  good life, I have refrained from sexual parts, I have denied my darker thoughts, I ressussitated that Ogg that I strangled for a bet. I am a good  Kyu Ra, I am!"<br>
			Just then he started, a queer sense in his fore clefts alerting him.<br>
			"Loar! We know you are in there!" a dark voice called from the other side of the front door. <br>
			"Come out with you forelegs tied in a bow, and your front legs, well, most of them, but  you know, leave one for hopping, but tie the rest of them into the most complicated knot you can manage! And put down any weapons you may have! Including you sinisterness!"<br>
			That could only be the voice of chief sooperint Endaant Jee M'ann! Oh fuck a hammer!<br>
			<br><Br>
			<p>Just then, Loar D'rummsee immediately wet her knicker parts and started to weep profoundly and energetically..<br>
			"Euuuuurgh!" was all Bi Sag had to offer the distressed posh and tall bacto-idiot. With that she started to move towards the front door.<br>
			"Stop! What are you doing! Jee M'ann is the worst fish tank, no I mean scoop of humility, oh Ra suckle it-" With that Krsz P'ekk was halted from further enlightening us with his thoughts on the nature of the perverted police constable, as Bi Sag, apparently getting into a bit of a habit now, struck him again, this time across the jowls with a full bottle of wine. It smashed exubriantly on contact and rendered the now recently-conscious-regained P'ekker slightly less conscious and soaked in thick red bacto wine. Unconscious.</p>
			<p>"Would it be weird if I drank P'ekker?" she asked after a worryingly short hesitation. "I mean, it's such a waste, and-" <br>
			"Help me escape! I will do anything you ask of me!" The desperation in poor rummsee's vocal parts was distressing to Bi Sag, who had a heart almost as large as her face. Alas, it was one that was made of yoghurt, although in it's favour it did have beneficial gut bacteria and plant seroids that are scientifically proven to lower cholesterol.<br>
			So, in the spirit of cameradery, and of saving one of her most prolific clients, she decided to help  her. Him. Her. (Loar d'Rumsee is a her now, since she wet herself).</p>
			<p>I tell you what, Loar, me old china fish knife, me buddy me old porcelain cracker pump, take off your garments, render yourself utterly and completely naked."<br>
			"Er, what, now? Come again? I'm not in any kind of state to achieve even semi-"
			"No you fool! Swap your clothes with this sleeping idiot here, nip off out the back, and I will serve old P'ekker up to the rozzers. It will take dopey bollocks Jee M'ann days of hideous torture to figure out he's got the wrong sap." Bi Sag looked well pleased with herself here. And very well she might, cos it's a pretty decent plan, what? Unless of course you were starting to empathise a little with the P'ekker, in which case, THE DASTARDLY BASTARD FUCKERS!<br>
			Loar D'Rummsee immediately ceased his shamefull weeping and winging and wailing and bemoaning, and instead focused his energies on a wicked cackle. One that would have verily chilled you to your bone-parts had you heard it with your ears. A right Richard III type of cackle. You know what I mean...</p>
			<p>"MWA HHEEE HAA HEEE HAAA" he cackled and cackled, while removing his vest and soggy knickers....</p>					
			<p>A swirling vortex of black and white swirly parts swirled about swirlishly, for some considerable time, before clearing and fading, to a general lack of swirlishness, and eventually to reveal a rank dark grey cell that wasn't swirly at all. Swirl.<br>
			P'ekker shook his enormous bacto head, and tried to stop the spinning. I really must start wearing a helmet when I am around Bi Sag, he thought ruefully. Indeed it was a common enough occurrence for him to be knocked about a bit when in the presense of the large faced wine merchant, but this whole waking up in an unusual place with no recollection of having got there, was relatively new to the simple minded cretin.<br>
			"You are awake."<br>
			"erf" P'ekker jumped in his seat. Or he would have done, had he not discovered, to his dismay, that he was in fact strapped down fairly securely with what appeared to be blood-soaked lady's stockings and cricket whites.<br>
			"I have been waiting over 6 bacto-minutes. You would do well not to keep a man like me waiting about. I am not a radiator." <br>
			P'ekker realised that this was a voice he both knew, and feared. His bowels shifted, swirlishly. Possibly in reference to the swirlish way in which consciousness had draped it's heavy self about the P'ekker only moments before.<br>
			"Er, Jee M'ann? Is that you? Cor, what a litter tray, I mean titty, no argh, Ra relight my fire, I mean relief! I have a crime I wish to report! I was struck, and I have no idea why I am here.." P'ekker realised that the dark figure in the corner of the room was moving towards him.<br>
			"Cor, strike a light, me old tobacco pouch, is that you?" The figure stopped it's approach quite suddenly, wafting an immaculately cricket-gloved hand about it's nose parts.<br>
			"I am, I'm sorry Jee M'ann, sir, erm, I had some prawns.. I'm rather nervous you know, can I, can I ask why I am childless, no, I mean Boris Johnson, RA burn my follicles, I mean, why am I erm, I appear to be <em>tied up</em>. Not that it's a problem! I just, I have plans today. It's my friend Ree djhard E'Glish's name day today. He is an Ogg.<br> If you mean to marry me.."<br>
			There was a silence, just past the point of becoming an awkward one, but not quite to the point where you would burst into spontaneous song or start touching yourself. <br>
			"Cease your mindless drivelling Loar D'rummsee. You are a foul, hideous, murderous, frog-fiddling wretch. Your are an odeous guff of a person. You are an oozing pus-filled death-rattle of a yoghurt-based lifeform. You will now confess to me the manner in which, and the motives behind your murder of the almost criminally innocent buffoon Ol Y Mags."<br>
			There followed another loosening of bowels, bowels which were already loose enough to require a belt.<br>
			"And while you are at it, stop shitting yourself you craven puss-filled buboe of a bacto-person. You are quite the most repulsively vomitous streak of bacto-piss I have ever had the extreme misfortune to drape my dead blue eyes upon. And I don't say that every day. Well, not more than once a day anyhow." <br>Jee M'ann, we will come to discover, was quite an angry person. It had been said in some pots around Leeche Harvester Square that the reason for his incurable fury was to do with the fact he had a rubber bollock. But those that said it didn't say it very loudly.<br>
			"Oh! Ha! I see! You silly, I mean, sir, you have the wrong Kyu Ra'a! I am Krsz P'ekk, the simple minded corpse botherer! I am not the Loar! Look!" P'ekker instinctively tried to lift his knicker parts to reveal his lower clefts, which were quite famously square, and sealed up like an old war wound. <br>
			Out of the darkness an electrified bacto-whip arced up, and slashed P'ekker accross his facial parts with a loud crack, like a sumo's botty with a loudspeaker.<br>
			"Ohhh WOE!" came the now predictable cry. "For the sins of the tall shall be visited upon the lawfully heighted innocents, o woe for-" Krsz's plaintive cries were cut short just then as the whip flashed accross his face parts again, and sliced poor P'ekker's words apart like a soft cheese sandwhich. <br>

			The octopus had impugned the mermaid's horticultural heritage, and left the kelp bed soon after the improbably perennial pairing. 
			It was the first time he had truly let his dark side out during a one-on-one session, and though the mermaid had this time survived intact and unbroken, Biscuit Legs had soonafter tarnished the tentative tranquility and put his size 19 tentacle right in it. A salacious suggestion regarding water parsnips had put paid to next summer's sojourn, and so it was with a heavy heart that our hero took his leave and drifted away into the murky depths of solitude forever. In the Indian Ocean.</p><br>

			<p>"-clearly the sign of a broken mind. Have him immediately incinerated. But don't forget a similie in a book is worth nine in a tabloid frenzy. Save the nipples. Bye now". The psychiatrist, a young catfish of startlingly bright colour, was trying his best to give off an air of experienced professionalism, and not one of a junior in the field who had inadvertantly landed such a high profile case. He put down the ciabbatta loaf, which, he had decided, was almost definitely not a telephone, and turned around on his swivel chair to look at his client.<br>
			After a pause sufficient, he hoped, to engender what is known in professional circles as a "pregnant atmosphere", whatever that means, and not a "pungent moss sphere" which, he was led to believe, was almost indistinguishable from the former but could affect vastly different results.</p>
			<p>"Mr Trousers, sorry to keep you waiting. Still, I suppose you have nowhere else to be." He shuffled some dairylea singles on his desk which had apparantly become confused as to whether they were supposed to be playing cards or cheese slices, and had decided, at the last minute, that everyone likes cheese but in reality very few people like playing cards, except gambling addicts, magicians, and Kettle fish, none of whom would be likely to be reading this novellette, and even if they were, they could get stuffed, the lot of em, the--<br>

			he squinted his eye and moved the cheese flap closer, "the crime of multiple homicide".<br>
			The client remained silent, his tiny black eyes still fixed to the floor.<br>
			"Perhaps we could start with you telling me what happened. Right at the beginning."</p>
			<p>The client at last looked up towards him, and for the first time the young psychiafish saw his eyes, and within them the twin black voids of grief and nausiating sexual desire. (He was quite intuitive for a catfish).<br>
			"Very well. But let it not be said that I did not warn you. Oh hang on. Let me warn you, that what you are about to hear is a story of love, desire and despair. A story so grief inspiring, so utterly despairingly bad it will make you long for a Julia Roberts film. A story so profoundly sinister and badly thought out it will make you long for a Wes Craven movie. And let it not be said I did not warn thee."<br>
			"It all started one morning, when I woke up with a bit of a trumpet trouser. I had had this dream you see. This strange dream. I still remember it as if it were yesterday..."						</p>

			<p>I was tending my kelp garden. It was very early in the morning and I had decided to go out and get some work done on the parsnips as I was having trouble sleeping. Just as I was plucking out a ripe and wonderful beauty, I looked upon it, and I saw it anew. It had a face. And verily that face did speak unto me.<br>
			"Biscuit. Biscuit Legs you must heed my words carefully. You seek excitement, you seek love, you seek validation. One of these will come to you, and the other two will be lost forevermore. In your quest you will face great dangers, and you will see death at every turn." <br>
			I was a little bit puzzled at this I must say. Anyway I cooked him up and ate him, wonderful spicy parsnip soup it was, and it tasted great. Better than any parsnip I had eaten before. Truly. "</p>
			<p>"Immediately after finishing the beautiful broth, I felt a strange feeling come over me, and one of my tentacles, the small one in the middle, started to harden. It's never done this before. It became as a piece of coral, so hard and brittle it was. And as it started to harden it started to rise, up to the heavens it did, and as it did so, fevered imaginings gripped my mind. I saw mermaids, mermaids everywhere..."</p>

			<h2>Welcome to the Iranian badger foetus western soap drama thriller, <em>Sett Up</em>, Act 1 Scene Scene 2*</h2>
			<p>Scene 1 was tragically lost during an altercation with an overexcited sniffer dog at Iranian customs and was destroyed by saliva and human feaces/blood</p>	
			<p><em>A badger hole, brightly lit. We see we are in a doctor's surgery. There is a big desk, with one of the things where you move a ball and it makes other balls move. They are quite cool aren't they. There is also an antique rollerdeck with all the cards completely blank. We can also see a large paper pad with obscene pictures doodled all over it. There also appears to be a generous sprinkling of carrotts all over the room.</em><br>
			<strong>It is Doctor Abdullah's sett, he has changed clothes and removed all traces of the badger foetii from his person. He is looking slightly traumatised, yet still at peace with the universe and most of it's contents, but with a very slight air of recalcitrant defiantic self-revulsion.</strong> <em>N.B. we may need someone of the calibre of Harrison Ford for this role, very complicated character</em></p>
			<em>Doctor A</em>Ay, I see Smi has cleaned my office and replaced the carrotts. May the universe continue in it's peaceful state. I am very glad. -<br>
			<em>Slight pause</em><br>
			<em>Doctor A </em>I seem to be talking to myself. How odd. It is almost as if I am trying to sett the scene for any observers who are extremely disappointed that Iraninan customs are so -<br>
			<em>The Doctor is cut off by a knock at the door. It is repeated almost as soon as it has ended, and then again. Then the door swings open and a large dust pan is ushered into the office by the paw of an unseen badger who we assume is the receptionist</em><br>
			<em>Doctor A </em>Thank you Smi. ArsalAn! My good friend, please be seated. Can I offer you a carrot?<br>
			<em>The dustpan, whom we can assume is ArsalAn, attempts to wedge itself onto a chair and recount a sorry tale of treachery and deceit, only to then remember it has no mouth parts. After a short and slightly awkward pause, the Doctor speaks</em><br>
			<em>Doctor A </em>Is there anything I can help with, Ars?<br>
			<em>Ars trembles up and down, in a what could be vaguely described as a nod, if it were being described by a politician in an expenses-receipt sort of way</em><br>
			<em>Doctor A </em>What's that? Pregnant? Well congratulations! So, what happens, when a dustpan, and a brush... you know.. erm, what I mean to say, er, well, as a Doctor, I am very curious, to, what kind, what will it, <br>
			<em>The dustpan jiggles again, in a manner indescribable from the first jiggle</em><br>
			<em>Doctor A </em> Alright, I was only asking! From a purely medical point of view..

			<h2>Small and the badger</h2>
			<p>One day a small was playing in the river, trying to smell as much like Thames as possible. It was a sunny day and as such it was customary for the small to splash about a bit and practice some rowing.
			The small furiously rowed, and puffed and panted, wondering if it was the fastest small in the world yet.</p>
			<p>"float like a kayak, sting like a torpedo" muttered small, it's mantra designed to keep up motivation on days when it would rather be sitting in a box eating hummus. Then "Woooah oops. Inane" the mutter turned into something like a shriek and the tiny boat started rotating in a circa circular fashion. "Odd. What's this then." And "WooooaHHHHH! Inane!"</p>
			<p>Before it knew what was  going on, the small found itself swirling down a swirly wet vortex of thames, almost as if someone had pulled the plug. "INAAAANNNNE" it's plaintive cries echoed down, until eventually the river becalmed, and nothing more was to be seen, except a size 1 sock floating next to a lilly.</p>
			<p>Small was falling. Quite fast. Anybody else would probably have been suffering a slight looseinng of bowels at this moment, but as small a) didn't have any bowels because it was a GURL, and b) was really rather tough and little, like a frozen bullet, it was fairly calm.</p>
			<p>WOOOOOOOOSH. PLOP.</p>
			<p>And with that,the small found itself sitting on a large grey chair, approximately 41.4 sizes too big for it's small bottom parts. <br>
			"Who are you then? You can burn 1600 calories by lying on a trampoline you know. Numbers".<br>
			Small looked over at the source of this amazing voice, and saw a tall thin looking eagerly at her, almost curiously. <br>
			<p>"Hullo. I am small. What place be this, what manner of species art thou?" asked our rowing heroine. <br>
			<p>"THIS PLACE IS DEEGEEEE. What are you doing here? Do you want to do some NUMBERS? I had a pork cassoulet last night, and it had 485 calories.</p>
			<p>It was then that small started to feel a bit nervous. What strange place was this, what was going on? It had a very bad feeling that life was going to change drastically, FOREVER.</p>

			<p>After an initial period of confusement and lots of utterances of "inane" the small found that the mysterious grey place she had materialised in was called DEeeGee, and it was a place where the mailer shot was revered as a God. This did not seem that strange to the small as in her world it was the paddle and tea pot that were held as joint deities.<br>
			There were good people in this place, but there was much to be feared also. For example there was a tall posh that would stalk about the land of DeeGee and fall in love at people in the face, or sometimes just stand over them and look at them intently for hours at a time.
