			<h2>Ron the sucidal ham sandwhich</h2>
			
			<p>There once was a ham sandwich called Gastric Ron. Gastric Ron lived in a pharmacy and had done so quite happily for seventeen sandwhich years.
			One day Ron was sitting on the shelf quietly rotting away, as no one had eaten him for literally days, when the pharmacist, Staircase Phillip, came over and said<br>
			"Ron. I am tired of seeing you cluttering up my shelf with your decaying self. Ham should be pink and tasty like a sunburnt Saturday, not green and mildewy like a dead jury.  
			You make me utterly utterly sick to my stomach parts and also quietly sad. Thus and so I am formally giving you 24 hours notice to vacate my pharmacy".<br>
			So it was that Staircase Phillip felt extraordinarily pleased with himself as he had been building up the courage to say this for over 41 and a half years. 
			Poor old Ron on the other hand was extremely sad and distressed, and thus decided to end his life.<br>
			In the back room he found a large supply of Zanex and resolved himself to take the lot with a bottle of parsnip gin that a tall handsome incredibly funny and great bearded guy gave him on 
			a night out in Weston-Super-Mare-upon-Croydon the previous weekend.<br>
			Only when it came to it, Ron discovered to his disdain that he had no mouth. Or indeed any orifices at all, which  went some way to explaining his slight depression and moribund sex life. <br>
			Although it didn't really explain the mouth ulcers.<br>
			Desperate and confused, Ron ran out into the road and threw himself to the ground, weeping, in the hope that a hungry dog might come by and scoff him up like a bacon crisp.<br>
			After 6 and a half untidy and bacon-free hours an old lady and an alsation came past in that order. Ron threw himself at the slavering demented doggy beast and cried<br>
			"Eat me now, foul slavering demented doggy beast, for I know not happiness in this mortal realm! And without happiness, what is life but a futile camembert! Do not look upon me as I die!"<br>
			The dog looked at Ron and cocked his head to one side. And then carefully burst into tears. He explained that he was a vegetarian and therefore could not be of any help in Ron's suicidal bacony ambitions;
			by funny coincidence he had also been going through quite a rough time of it just recently.<br>
			It seemed his canine peers had been very hurtful about some of his life choices and were mocking him on a daily basis. They had been calling him names like "Piss-skip", "Shyte-hawk", 
			"Cum beaker", "Dangerous Kidney", and "Colin". Although he didn't mind Colin quite so much as that was his name.<br>
			So it came to pass that together they concocted a plan: a plan to end their lives together, at midnight.</p><br>
			<p>Several hours later Ron and Colin met up at an industrial estate in north west Penge, just beyond Sydenham West, but not as far as Crystal Palace Observatory South. 
			It was actually about a quarter past midnight as Ron had had an unplanned masturbate before setting off and Colin was urinating out of the wrong hole.<br>
			"Did you bring the electrified trouser press Col?"<br>
			"I sure did buddy old pot. Did you remember the rubber pants and the elasticated frogspawn glove?"<br>
			"Certainment, mon frere. All is here." Ron looked at Colin uncertainly and then at the extra large rubber y-fronts he was wearing above his tail parts, and entertained certain thoughts.<br>
			"Please refrain from entertaining certain thoughts, guy. This is a strictly business arrangement yo. Are you still keen on going through with this or what?" <br>
			Ron tried to look at colin with as calm a face as was possible, given the current emotional turmoil that was turmoiling in his head area, and also given the fact that he was a ham sandwich and 
			therefore did not have an actual head or face part at all, except in the imagination of a deranged and bored foot.<br>
			"Yeeeah. Come on, let's get this over with". And with that Colin waddled over to Ron, (for the rubber Y-fronts were very loose and he had to do that funny walk to stop them from falling down, 
			you know that walk you have to do sometimes, 
			it looks like you have done a runny one or you are trying to grip a frogspawn in your nought).<br>
			They shared an awkward silent embrace during which Ron attempted three times to climb inside the rubber Y-fronts and Colin diplomatically blocked his entrance with the strategic 
			placement of his furry dog tail.<br>
			They climbed the forty three flights of stairs that took them to the top of the disused sock factory and made their way to the edge of the rooftop.<br>
			"It's quite a view isn't it. I think I can see Forest Hill zoo from here. Look, is that a giraffe?" Ron would have been squinting at this point and putting his hand accross his eyebrows, in that way 
			that always helps you see things that are small or far away, but being in an extremely ham-sandwhichy sort of mood he failed to do this and settled instead for an inquisitive yet crusty lean.<br>
			An especially green and manky part of his ham fell off and floted down the side of the building.<br>
			"Er, I think that's actually Lower Sydenham Cathedral you know."<br>

		   <h2>The yoghurty but still interesting existence of the Be Na Kol</h2>
			<h4><em>The woeful tale of a heightist community living inside a yoghurt</em></h4>
			<p>This part of the universe is thick and white; creamy yet nebulous. Like a forgotten soufflé in a snowstorm. Or a bubble bath squinted at by a fostered owl with mild depression.</br></br>
 
It was said that it was similar in colour to the Goddess Ra's foot that had never seen daylight. (And was made of cream).
This was interesting as the population of Be Nna Koll, a species evolved (slightly) from yoghurt fungus that did not actually grow feet (or hands) of any description, most probably would not have been able to accurately discern the difference between a foot (creamy or otherwise), and a medium sized redundancy package.
Indeed, seemingly bizarre and incongruous religious concepts were commonplace in Be Nna Koll and thus it was most fortuitous that the people who lived there were not by their nature very inquisitive. And certainly not prone to cynicism of any sort.</br></br>

Except when it came to madras.</br></br>
 
As Be Nna Koll is essentially an enormous cosmic bowl of yoghurt that revolves around the Great Unk' al Bhens system, an even enormouser crispy ring that from a lot of angles resembles an even more enormouser crispy ring that is further away, it had already occurred to most of the Kyu Ra'a Nailz that theirs was a most unlikely existence and would not benefit from any kind of existential scrutiny. And it most certainly would not benefit at all from the existence of Madras.</br></br>
 
One of the Kyu Ra'a Nailz that was particularly unlikely to scrutinise his own existence, or very much anything at all, was Krsz p'ekk, a simple, slightly deranged, and generally quite happy fungus-based life form.
He was currently to be found celebrating the birthday of his neighbour's pet Ogg, a small six-headed domesticated beast much revered by the Kyu Ra'a Nailz. The small Ogg was called Ree djhard and, being of an even lower order of intelligence than the Kyu Ra'a Nailz, had absolutely no idea that today was it's birthday. </br></br>

Oggs had a bit of a blind spot for Wednesdays.</br></br>

This struck Krsz P'ekk as profoundly sad, so he decided there and then that he was going to attempt to infuse in the dog some form of sentience, a rudimentary intelligence, if only so that it could properly enjoy it’s birthday celebrations, the ones that Krsz had so meticulously organised for over 5 minutes that morning. And maybe perhaps be able to use a calendar properly.</br></br>

 
A curious character trait amongst the Kyu Ra'a Nailz was a violent distrust of anyone shorter or taller than the universally agreed height. Generally the population would, as a whole, try to stick to the status quo and not grow any more or less than 3 and a half pots in length, but, as in any civilisation across the cosmos, there were those rebellious and insurrectionary types who decided being different was better than conforming. Evil swines.
Every so often, one of these villains was to be found at Leeche Harvester Square, being first ritually humiliated, and then, if they were lucky, publicly executed. Krsz P'ekk just so happened to be quite interested in public executions and never missed an event. He was also quite good friends with the bacterium that was in charge of disposing of the lengthy or titchy cadavers. And so it was that a plan hatched in this young simpleton's mind, or the place where his mind would have been, had he not been a fictitious and most improbable character made entirely of mould and mind-wet.</br></br>
 
"By Ra, hello, have fun!" squeaked Krsz P'ekk in his oddly high-pitched voice, as he approached the chief executioner bacteria based thing.  
"May Ra make you prolific in the pot, Krsz P'ekk, you spoonless wreck!" was the customarily oblique and well-intentioned spouting-sult from Dayv Gbknee. </br></br>

Dayv Gbknee was an odd sort of character, even for a Kyu Ra'a Nailz.
Although not in a height-based capacity. He was exactly the correct height. 
The reason he was odd was that he actually didn't exist in any believable or conventional sense. The Kyu Ra'a Nailz, being yoghurt-bacteria based lifeforms, consisted of a semi-dense liquid/gas mix of spores, promulgated neutrinos and coagulated fluff, which is all far too complicated for me to explain here in any credible way without sending you off to the wet. Dayv however, existed metaphysically in a separate dimensional state from the rest of his fluff-based kin, and, as such, could only actually be perceived by other Kyu Ra'a Nailz if they pressed a rusty spatula against their foreheads and squinted very tightly whilst thinking of wind-farms. </br></br>

However, he was a very pleasant and friendly Kyu Ra, who also happened to be in charge of public executions, so made friends easily, despite this unlikely hindrance. Which is saying something, if you ask me.</br></br>

In any case, Krsz was not one to be put off easily when it came to making friends. </br></br>

Indeed it was so rare that anyone voluntarily spoke to him, that he had started to entertain certain thoughts involving cable ties and handcuffs, and porcelain. Not that handcuffs would be any use on a yoghurt bacteria based lifeform. But porcelain was certainly a dangerous thought. And one he enjoyed immensely.</br></br>
 
"I have had an lampshade! No, a wall chart. No! Ra deny it, I mean.... er, an IDEA!" 
Krsz beamed with satisfaction at the magnificent personal achievement of having successfully completed an entire sentence without the intended recipient having run away to commit suicide in the neck parts, atomically collapsed, or forced the acceleration of universal entropy to the point of quantum oblivion through sheer desperate willpower.</br></br>
 
"You are not holding the rusty spatula correctly, the Krsz. Keep it up. If we're going to be abstract metaphysical character types we at least have to be consistent. Don't be a deckchair." 
"Oh indeed Dayv! Eff you! No, sorry, I mean runt chaps. No, I mean THANK YOU! And how did the execution go today? I was sorry to lick it, no... squeeze her, AARF, Ra string it up long, I mean miss it!" 
"It went well enough, young cretin. I used washing up liquid to turn him to stink, the illegally-short bastard face, with his tiny height." Dayv spat fluff. 
"Oh, washing liquid, my absolute third or fourth favourite method! Joy-faces! What did you do with the buttock, argh, er, the broadband, er, no, um... the REMAINS!" cried Krysz, his bacto nipples hardening with eagerness like a keen chocolate trumpet in the freezer.</br></br>
 
"Leave off Krysz you filthy table, I told you before, you are not allowed to sexually interfere with the-” 
"Er, no no no nothing like that! I want to scoop out the soggy brain parts and stuff them inside my neighbour's pet Ogg, Ree djhard. I love him and play with him every day but he is just too sexy, er... I mean egg-shaped bossanova, I mean, er…. Ra touch it very lightly! I mean too stupid!"</br></br>
 
Krysz P'ekk's conversational skills tended to improve after around 5 minutes or so, but he rarely achieved more than two minutes with sentient life forms. Fortunately. </br></br>
 
"Ra bless your toes until they melt, that is an excellent idea. I cannot believe a tin tray like you came up with it!" cried Dayv, his tiny yoghurty mouth flaps quivering in excitement and joy.</br>
 "Marry me! I will take you to New York! I love you!" declared Krysz, immediately dropping on to one hind-cleft and scrabbling about for his lassoo.</br></br>
 
"Get away you odd fucker! What do you mean New York, what is that?" Dayv started to back away from Kryz, his mouth flaps immediately drying up like last night’s naan in the fridge no matter how well you wrapped it in foil or even cling film.</br></br>
 
"O lord, it's happening again, I must save myself, I'm too sexy for Bacto-prison! Ooohoooohh! By Ra! I summon you now my undead warrior Ogg, Ree djhard E'Glish….. EMIT SCORN! 
No... er, POLITICALLY SANCTION! Ra, insert it very gently! I mean ATTAAAACK!"</br></br>
 
Dayv looked troubled. But only slightly. </br></br>

This was an odd turn of events for two reasons. Firstly, the two were quite good friends and had never before summoned demonic pets to attack each other, and secondly because the dim witted Ogg who was not demonic in any way was not actually there to hear his good friend's cries. It was also funny because at that moment, Bi hag Rannell the wine merchant entered the execution pots and tripped over Krsz's gently quivering left cleftal part and fell on top of him in a screaming tumbling vortex of chaos and death and destruction and oblivion!!!</br></br>

			The octopus had impugned the mermaid's horticultural heritage, and left the kelp bed soon after the improbably perennial pairing. 
			It was the first time he had truly let his dark side out during a one-on-one session, and though the mermaid had this time survived intact and unbroken, Biscuit Legs had soonafter tarnished the tentative tranquility and put his size 19 tentacle right in it. A salacious suggestion regarding water parsnips had put paid to next summer's sojourn, and so it was with a heavy heart that our hero took his leave and drifted away into the murky depths of solitude forever.

			<p>"-clearly the sign of a broken mind. Have him immediately incinerated. But don't forget a similie in a book is worth nine in a tabloid frenzy. Save the nipples. Bye now". The psychiatrist, a young catfish of startlingly bright colour, was trying his best to give off an air of experienced professionalism, and not one of a junior in the field who had inadvertantly landed such a high profile case. He put down the ciabbatta loaf, which, he had decided, was almost definitely not a telephone, and turned around on his swivel chair to look at his client.<br>
			After a pause sufficient, he hoped, to engender what is known in professional circles as a "pregnant atmosphere", whatever that means, and not a "pungent moss sphere" which, he was led to believe, was almost indistinguishable from the former but could affect vastly different results.</p>
			<p>"Mr Trousers, sorry to keep you waiting. Still, I suppose you have nowhere else to be." He shuffled some dairylea singles on his desk which had apparantly become confused as to whether they were supposed to be playing cards or cheese slices, and had decided, at the last minute, that everyone likes cheese but in reality very few people like playing cards, except gambling addicts, magicians, and Kettle fish, none of whom would be likely to be reading this novellette, and even if they were, they could get stuffed, the lot of em, the--<br>

			he squinted his eye and moved the cheese flap closer, "the crime of multiple homicide".<br>
			The client remained silent, his tiny black eyes still fixed to the floor.<br>
			"Perhaps we could start with you telling me what happened. Right at the beginning."</p>
			<p>The client at last looked up towards him, and for the first time the young psychiafish saw his eyes, and within them the twin black voids of grief and nausiating sexual desire. (He was quite intuitive for a catfish).<br>
			"Very well. But let it not be said that I did not warn you. Oh hang on. Let me warn you, that what you are about to hear is a story of love, desire and despair. A story so grief inspiring, so utterly despairingly bad it will make you long for a Julia Roberts film. A story so profoundly sinister and badly thought out it will make you long for a Wes Craven movie. And let it not be said I did not warn thee."<br>
			"It all started one morning, when I woke up with a bit of a trumpet trouser. I had had this dream you see. This strange dream. I still remember it as if it were yesterday..."						</p>

			<p>I was tending my kelp garden. It was very early in the morning and I had decided to go out and get some work done on the parsnips as I was having trouble sleeping. Just as I was plucking out a ripe and wonderful beauty, I looked upon it, and I saw it anew. It had a face. And verily that face did speak unto me.<br>
			"Biscuit. Biscuit Legs you must heed my words carefully. You seek excitement, you seek love, you seek validation. One of these will come to you, and the other two will be lost forevermore. In your quest you will face great dangers, and you will see death at every turn." <br>
			I was a little bit puzzled at this I must say. Anyway I cooked him up and ate him, wonderful spicy parsnip soup it was, and it tasted great. Better than any parsnip I had eaten before. Truly. "</p>
			<p>"Immediately after finishing the beautiful broth, I felt a strange feeling come over me, and one of my tentacles, the small one in the middle, started to harden. It's never done this before. It became as a piece of coral, so hard and brittle it was. And as it started to harden it started to rise, up to the heavens it did, and as it did so, fevered imaginings gripped my mind. I saw mermaids, mermaids everywhere..."</p>

			<h2>Small and the badger</h2>
			<p>One day a small was playing in the river, trying to smell as much like Thames as possible. It was a sunny day and as such it was customary for the small to splash about a bit and practice some rowing.
			The small furiously rowed, and puffed and panted, wondering if it was the fastest small in the world yet.</p>
			<p>"float like a kayak, sting like a torpedo" muttered small, it's mantra designed to keep up motivation on days when it would rather be sitting in a box eating hummus. Then "Woooah oops. Inane" the mutter turned into something like a shriek and the tiny boat started rotating in a circa circular fashion. "Odd. What's this then." And "WooooaHHHHH! Inane!"</p>
			<p>Before it knew what was  going on, the small found itself swirling down a swirly wet vortex of thames, almost as if someone had pulled the plug. "INAAAANNNNE" it's plaintive cries echoed down, until eventually the river becalmed, and nothing more was to be seen, except a size 1 sock floating next to a lilly.</p>
			<p>Small was falling. Quite fast. Anybody else would probably have been suffering a slight looseinng of bowels at this moment, but as small a) didn't have any bowels because it was a GURL, and b) was really rather tough and little, like a frozen bullet, it was fairly calm.</p>
			<p>WOOOOOOOOSH. PLOP.</p>
			<p>And with that,the small found itself sitting on a large grey chair, approximately 41.4 sizes too big for it's small bottom parts. <br>
			"Who are you then? You can burn 1600 calories by lying on a trampoline you know. Numbers".<br>
			Small looked over at the source of this amazing voice, and saw a tall thin looking eagerly at her, almost curiously. <br>
			<p>"Hullo. I am small. What place be this, what manner of species art thou?" asked our rowing heroine. <br>
			<p>"THIS PLACE IS DEEGEEEE. What are you doing here? Do you want to do some NUMBERS? I had a pork cassoulet last night, and it had 485 calories.</p>
			<p>It was then that small started to feel a bit nervous. What strange place was this, what was going on? It had a very bad feeling that life was going to change drastically, FOREVER.</p>

			<p>After an initial period of confusement and lots of utterances of "inane" the small found that the mysterious grey place she had materialised in was called DEeeGee, and it was a place where the mailer shot was revered as a God. This did not seem that strange to the small as in her world it was the paddle and tea pot that were held as joint deities.<br>
			There were good people in this place, but there was much to be feared also. For example there was a tall posh that would stalk about the land of DeeGee and fall in love at people in the face, or sometimes just stand over them and look at them intently for hours at a time.
