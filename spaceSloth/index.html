		<h2>Space Sloth say Embrace Your Cosmic Insignificance tiny cosmic nought!</h2>
			<p>Heed the wise words of Space Sloth! Your continued existence is so utterly futile and incomprehensibly improbable as to make it 
			almost certain that you don't really exist.</p>
			Cease this pointless charade you dirty parade of geraniums! What is the point, really? </p>
			<p>At the very least this knowledge should help you smoothly succumb to entropy like cocoa being stirred with my Spoon Of Truth.</p><br>

		<h2>Space Sloth say Indolence The Only True State of Being</h2>
		<p>If the Universe is infinite, then it is infinitely ridic, and so is everything in it. </p>
		<p>Which means nothing makes sense. Including you. Which explains a lot if you ask me. So go back to bed and try not to think about how shambolically
		incompetent you are at existence. </p>

		<h2>Space Sloth say Your Existence Matters Not</h2>
		<p>An apathetic universe is indifferent to your struggles, quoth the Space Sloth. And let's think about that - surelemement he hath a point here.<br>
		One must resolve oneself to one's cosmic insignificance in order to be at peace. You are a crisp packet blowing in the wind, in a carp park that is blowing in the wind, in another car park that is blowing in the wind, in another-....etc</p><br>

		<h2>Space Sloth say One must have Chaos Inside Oneself </h2>
		<p>And Space Sloth spaketh to the insolent man again: 
				"One must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star" </p>
		<p>And the man, for whom philosophy was a passion endured, did curse his enigmatic Creator and did throw a hissy fit 
		of apostasy. He turned his back on his the One True Spacey Obliqueness, before casting himself off the mountain to his death, and hiding the body.</p><br>
