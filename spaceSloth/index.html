			<h2>Don't worry. In 150 years no one will remember you'</h2>
			<p>Today's Truth Missile of Truth missiling away truthfully, cutting through the shyte spectrum towards your pointless head-hole is this:
			Always try your best. Or don't. It doesn't really matter, because in a relatively short amount of time you will be dead, no one will remember you, and nothing you ever did will have had any impact on the universe. LOVE.</p><br>

			<h2>Homogeneous and small, you resemble some grit in a driveway in a painting of Cape Town. But this is Good, not Bad.</h2>
			<p>Today's missile of truth sent fluttering towards your thought-cave like a butterfly of sense, is a simple one. To be at one with the cosmos, you must understand that you are a tiny meaningless part of it, invisible to all, and that if you didn't exist (which you can't be sure you actually do) nothing would be any different at all! Happy Thursday! :)</p><br>

			<h2>Heed the Space Sloth: Just lie down because your utter nihility is and always won't be.</h2>			
			<p>This may or may not sound a bit like some insanity you those of you uninitiated in the ways of the Sloth, 
			and quite possibly, it is. Alas there is no way to tell, and there never will be. So let's all lie down and try to forget about it all.
			Just remember, although you don't fully exist, neither does Bruno Mars, let that provide some comfort.</p>

			<h2>Space Sloth say Embrace Your Cosmic Insignificance tiny cosmic nought!</h2>
			<p>Heed the wise words of Space Sloth! Your continued existence is so utterly futile and incomprehensibly improbable as to make it 
			almost certain that you don't really exist.</p>
			Cease this pointless charade you dirty parade of geraniums!</p>
			<p>At the very least this knowledge should help you smoothly succumb to entropy like cocoa being stirred with my Spoon Of Truth.</p><br>

			<h2>Space Sloth say Indolence The Only True State of Being</h2>
			<p>If the Universe is infinite, then it is infinitely ridic, and so is everything in it. </p>
			<p>Which means nothing makes sense. Including you. Which explains a lot if you ask me. So go back to bed and try not to think about how shambolically
			incompetent you are at existence. </p><br>

			<h2>Space Sloth say Your Existence Matters Not</h2>
			<p>An apathetic universe is indifferent to your struggles, quoth the Space Sloth. And let's think about that - surelemement he hath a point here.<br>
			One must resolve oneself to one's cosmic insignificance in order to be at peace. You are a crisp packet blowing in the wind, in a car park that is blowing in the wind, inside another car park that is also blowing in the wind, in another-....etc etc you get the drift etc </p><br>

			<h2>Space Sloth say One must have Chaos Inside Oneself </h2>
			<p>And Space Sloth spaketh to the insolent man again: 
					"One must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star" </p>
			<p>And the man, for whom philosophy was a passion endured, did curse his enigmatic Creator and did throw a hissy fit 
			of apostasy. He turned his back on his the One True Spacey Obliqueness, before casting himself off the mountain to his death, and hiding the body.</p><br>
